Introduction
------------

To be written: Malaria, Bednets, Coverage, Data Sources, Outline of
what follows.


Compartmental Model
-------------------

For a particular country, c:

W[t] := number of nets in warehouses at time t
H[t] := number of nets in households at time t

m[t] := number of nets manufactured during time period t
d[t] := number of nets distributed during time period t
l[t] := number of nets lost or discarded during time period t

The compartments are connected as follows:

  m  +---+  d  +---+  l
---->| W |---->| H |---->
     +---+     +---+


Model parameters
----------------

p_l := The probability a net is lost during a time period
d[t] := the number of nets distributed during time period t
m[t] := the number of nets manufactured during time period t


Model Dynamics
--------------

W[t+1] = W[t] + m[t] - d[t]
H[t+1] = H[t] + d[t] - l[t]
l[t] = H[t] * p_l


Assumptions in Dynamics
-----------------------

The model dynamics make two major assumptions:

1. Every net resides in a warehouse for at least one time period
   before being distributed to a household.

2. Every net is lost/discarded independently at random at every time
   step with the same probability.


Statistical Model
-----------------

There are 5 types of data that will drive parameter estimation:

Manufacturing Data - Information on the number of nets procured by
each country for distribution;  initial model::

    m_i ~ m(t_i) + N(0, s_m^2)


Distribution Data - Information on the number of nets distributed
through the public sector supply chain in each country;  initial model::

    d1_i ~ d(t_i) + N(0, s_d^2)


Household Survey Data - Information from DHS, MICS, and MIS where
head-of-household reports number of nets and time when each net was
obtained;  initial model for total number of nets::

    N_i ~ H(t_i) + N(0, s_{N_i}^2)
        (here t_i is the year of the survey used to compute N_i)

initial model for number of nets obtained during a particular year::

    d2_i ~ d(t^e_i) * (1 - p_l)^{t^s_i - t^e_i} + N(0, s_{d2_i}^2)
        (here t^s_i is the year of the survey, and t^e_i is the year
        of the estimate)


Net Retention Data - Information from studies on how many nets were
still in households a certain amount of time after they were
distributed::

    r_i ~ (1 - p_l)^{T_i} + N(0, s_r^2)

        (where r_i := fraction retained and T_i := follow up time for
        the study)

Priors
------

To be determined.

All of the s_x terms in the statistical model above need to be
assigned hyperpriors.
