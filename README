Introduction
------------

To be written: Malaria, Bednets, Coverage, Data Sources, Outline of
what follows.


Compartmental Model
-------------------

For a particular country, c:

W[t] := number of nets in warehouses at time t
H1[t] := number of 1-year-old nets in households at time t
H2[t] := number of 2-year-old nets in households at time t
H3[t] := number of 3-year-old nets in households at time t

m[t] := number of nets manufactured during time period t
d[t] := number of nets distributed during time period t
l1[t] := number of 1-year-old nets lost or discarded during time period t
l2[t] := number of 2-year-old nets lost or discarded during time period t

The compartments are connected as follows:

  m  +---+  d  +----+ 1-l1 +----+ 1-l2 +----+ 1
---->| W |---->| H1 |----->| H2 |----->| H3 |--->
     +---+     +----+      +----+      +----+
                  |         |
                  | l1      | l2
                  +---->    +---->

A quantity of interest that can be calculated from this model is the
expected time it takes a net to reach a household.  Assuming the nets
are distributed with a first-in-first-out system, this is:

T[t] = \sum_{x > 0} (m[t] - (d[t] + ... + d[t+x] - W[t])^+)^+ / m[t]


Model parameters
----------------

p_l := the probability a net is lost during a time period
d[t] := the number of nets distributed during time period t (t = 0, ..., 9)
m[t] := the number of nets manufactured during time period t (t = 0, ..., 9)
W_0 := the number of nets in warehouses at time 0
H_0 := the number of nets in households at time 0

(The model for a single country has 23 parameters.)


Model Dynamics
--------------

W[t+1] = W[t] + m[t] - d[t];  W[0] = W_0
H1[t+1] = d[t];  H1[0] = H_0/3
H2[t+1] = H1[t] - l1[t];  H2[0] = H_0/3
H3[t+1] = H2[t] - l2[t];  H3[0] = H_0/3
l1[t] = H1[t] * p_l
l2[t] = H2[t] * p_l


Assumptions in Dynamics
-----------------------

The model dynamics make two major assumptions:

1. Every 1-year-old and 2-year-old net is lost/discarded independently
   at random with the same probability during the year.

2. Every 3-year-old net is discarded during the year.


Statistical Model
-----------------

There are 5 types of data that will drive parameter estimation:

Manufacturing Data - Information on the number of nets procured by
each country for distribution;  initial model::

    m_i ~ m[t_i] * (1 + N(0, s_m^2))


Administrative Distribution Data - Information on the number of nets
distributed through the public sector supply chain in each country;
initial model::

    d1_i ~ (1 + e_d) * d[t_i] * (1 + N(0, s_d^2))


Household Survey Data - Information from DHS, MICS, and MIS where
head-of-household reports number of nets and time when each net was
obtained;  initial model for total number of nets::

    N_i ~ H[t_i] + N(0, s_{N_i}^2)
        (here t_i is the year of the survey used to compute N_i)

initial model for number of nets obtained during a particular year::

    d2_i ~ d(t^e_i) * (1 - p_l)^{t^s_i - t^e_i - .5} + N(0, s_{d2_i}^2)
        (here t^s_i is the year of the survey, and t^e_i is the year
        of the estimate)


Net Retention Data - Information from studies on how many nets were
still in households a certain amount of time after they were
distributed::

    r_i ~ (1 - p_l)^{T_i} + N(0, s_r^2)

        (where r_i := fraction retained and T_i := follow up time for
        the study)

Priors
------

logit(p_l) ~ Normal(logit(.05), tau=1)
s_r ~ Gamma(20, 20/.15)
s_m ~ Gamma(20, 20/.05)

s_d ~ Normal with mean and standard from empirical Bayes approach (described below)
e_d ~ Normal with mean and standard from empirical Bayes approach (described below) 

d[t] ~ Lognormal(log(min_i(d_i)), 1)
m[t] ~ Lognormal(log(min_i(m_i)), 1)

W_0 ~ Lognormal(log(1000), 10)
H_0 ~ Lognormal(log(1000), 10)

log(W[t+1]/W[t]) ~ Normal(0, 1^2)
log(H[t+1]/H[t]) ~ Normal(0, 1^2)

T[t] ~ Normal(1, 1^2)

W[t], H[t] >= 0


Empirical Bayes Priors
----------------------

Instead of just making up priors for the systematic error and sampling
error in the administrative distribution data, we will use the
time-country data where both administrative and survey data are
available.  For this we use the same model as above, but taking the
survey data as "truth":

    d1_i ~ (1 + e_d) * d2_i * (1 + N(0, s_d^2))

To complete this model, we use uninformative hyper-priors on e_d and s_d:
    s_d ~ Gamma(1., 1./.05)
    e_d ~ Normal(0., 1./.5**2)
